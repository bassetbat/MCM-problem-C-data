They have some by Booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base. I, personally, dont care for these the way they suggest to use them. The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking.<br />There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D<br />Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved!<br />So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!\"], 104: [\"They are cute, but there aren't enough air holes.

I gave her a Soothie to use before, and bought this thinking I'd only use it as back up or when we go somewhere because it has a handle that I can attach a holder/clip.  The first time I had my baby used this, I could see by the way that she was sucking it that it was a lot more comfortable and fit better in her mouth than the Soothie. Because the nipple is softer, more flattened, and has a narrow base, the pacifier stays in her mouth better than the Soothie.  It will stay in her mouth sometimes the entire length of her nap or for a few hours each night before falling out, even after she stopped sucking.  With the Soothie, it kept falling out of her mouth as soon as she stopped sucking.  The other day, I tried to give her her Soothie back to try again, and she sucked it and it fell out of her mouth. I kept putting it back in, but either she pushed it out with her tongue, or it was falling out because of the way she was sucking (she was used to how this pacifier kinda &#34;hangs&#34; in mouth better because of the narrow base and fatter nipple). So I actually tried sucking on both pacifiers myself - this one is MUCH softer and natural feeling than the stiff, straight nipple of the Soothie.  If I was a baby, I'd definitely prefer sucking on this one! I personally think it probably resembles a real nipple more because of its soft, compressed/flatter nipple.  I breastfeed, and when my baby feeds, my nipple looks flattened when she pulls off.<br /><br />The only negative about this pacifier is that water gets into the inside of the pacifier whenever I wash them.  I always wash them by hand with some warm water and soap and ALWAYS get water into the nipple.  It leaks in somehow from the base.  I don't think there's a way to take of the base without breaking it to clean the inside.  But I guess it doesn't matter because that part doesn't come in contact with my baby's mouth.  It is unsightly though seeing water spots on the inside of the nipple (makes it look dirty). We have really hard water though, so that may be why.  I always shake the water out as much as I can and let it air dry before giving it to my baby.\"], 477: ['Good'], 478: ['hard to open when you are sleepy or in darkness'], 479: [\"It's not the pacifiers fault I think my son just doesn't like them.

like being in the baby k'tan (tried 2 sizes just to be sure), will tolerate the beco gemini for a bit, and hates the ergo baby with newborn insert (also seems to be way too warm for a newborn to sit in during the summer). both the beco and ergo seem better for older babies/toddlers (can attest from experience with my first daughter the ergo is great when baby is bigger).<br /><br />i bought the balboa sling one day before heading out shopping without checking reviews first and my baby loved it. slept peacefully the whole time, was able to feed her easily, and always had her little face in view. when i took the time to check for reviews i was shocked to see the worrisome info about potential chin to chest problems and suffocation in newborns. researched further and most of the info i found was related to infant deaths in 2010 with a similar, but still different sling. it also seems the babies who suffered were premature or underweight so definitely do not use with children under 8lbs.<br /><br />the chin to chest is also a problem that can occur in an infant carseat or swing, but obviously i have not stopped using a carseat. honestly though, using the sling is not a risk i

umbrella, or other type - that i have used (i have used the uppababy, peg perego, and a few other brands). used for 2 kids so far, and it is in great condition. here's why i think it is best: 1) these wheels are awesome and so, so durable. they have yet to receive a flat or a puncture (i hope never!), and we only fill up air maybe twice a year. the ride is so smooth, and i am able to push this stroller with one hand. 2) the double tray - genius (why don't all other strollers have this option??) my kids both loved the tray - they were able to put their cups/bottles, food, toys, etc. while i was able to keep more than enough in the &#34;parent&#34; tray - a water bottle, my keys, phone, money, etc. 3) super easy to fold 4) the price - $103? so affordable, and you get more than your money's worth - i would think this is at least a $250 stroller. most strollers under $150 are usually so cheaply made and have horrible wheels that make you suffer to no end and pray that your child will start walking so that you do not need to use a stroller anymore.... the baby trend is clearly in a different league, and i really appreciate that the manufacturer takes our budget into consideration. there is no reason that a parent on a budget needs to suffer with a low quality stroller just because they can't afford or don't want to spend $400+ on a stroller. 5) the canopy - so flexible and able to fully cover my child from the sun.\"], 1401: ['cute gate and quality materials used, but i have tried it on the inside of the door frame, on the door frame, and even across

It has all the features I like to see in a bag.<br /><br />There are synthetic zippers, which are easier to work, and metal zipper pulls.  The hardware is a mix of metal and plastic.  The one vulnerability I see in the bag are the plastic adjustable sliders on the strap. The material is waterproof 600d nylon, something I see many lightweight backpacks are made of and perfect for a diaper bag.  The design is new-generation stylish, but with an old-fashioned dollop of fun I like.  It’s a more modern design line that has enough of a selection to suit everyone.<br /><br />The inside of the bag’s design pops and is totally functional with all kinds of pockets ... zippered elasticized, and simple.  I definitely like the small included changing pad that will certainly come in handy.  There’s a metal quick release swivel snap for those house or car keys if you’re walking around.  The Ecosusi has a large enough capacity to hold diapers, a change of clothes, snacks, and other essentials needed for a small excursion.<br /><br />I do have stroller straps I can use to hook this diaper bag on my Graco for quick access.  As I mentioned, in does have those snap on nylon straps if you don’t have one.  It does have 1-1/2” nylon straps so I can swing it over my shoulder or, if I prefer, I can carry it by the sturdy rolled up nylon handles.
